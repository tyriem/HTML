				<p>As Apple Corp. transitioned from the powerPC architecture of CPUs to Intel's X86 microprocessors the company combined their PowerBook and iBook lines of laptops under the Macbook moniker. The line has had several naming conventions changes over the years but its primary lines are: Macbook, Macbook Air & Macbook Pro. In 2020 at WWDC Apple revealed that the series will follow on through the company's again switching its CPU architecture to in-house ARM based 'Apple Silicon' processors.</a></p>
