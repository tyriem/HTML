		<h2>Where They Live</h2>
		
		
	<!-- Paragraphs - Habitat -->
		<p>Cheetahs are found across Africa, primarily in northern Africa; the Sahel (the transition region between the Sahara to the north and the Sudanian Savanna to the south); and they are scattered across eastern and southern Africa, according to the Smithsonian. A small population lives in Iran, where they are critically endangered.</p>

		<p>Cheetahs live in a variety of environments. According to the African Wildlife Foundation, cheetahs can be found in dry forests, grasslands, open plains and desert regions. These large felines do not need much water to survive â€” they get most of what they need while eating.</p>

		<p>According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN's) Red List of Threatened Species, most cheetah subspecies are considered vulnerable. All populations of cheetah are on the decline, with the total population estimated at less than 7,000 individuals.</p>
